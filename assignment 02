[question.1]While traversing a single circular linked list the last element must be pointed to the first element in other words the last node must contain the address
of the first element of the linked list. So that the iteration is completed all over the linked list .

[Question.2]  
Practical applications of circular linked list are :
1)Multiplayer Games: All the Players are kept in a Circular Linked List and the pointer keeps on moving forward as a player's chance ends.
2)Computing Resources: Circular Linked Lists is used to manage the computing resources of the computer.
3)Fionacci Heap: Circular Linked List is also used in the implementation of advanced data structures such as a Fibonacci Heap.
4)Computer Networking:Circular linked list is also used in computer networking for token scheduling.
5)Implementation of Data Structure: Data structures such as stacks and queues are implemented with the help of the circular linked lists.
6)Audio/Video Streaming: Circular linked list is also used in audio and video streaming,for ex. when one copmlete audio list finishes playing in music player then it
again starts playing from start.
